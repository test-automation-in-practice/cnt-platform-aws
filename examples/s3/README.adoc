= AWS: S3

This module demonstrates the basics of using and testing the AWS Simple Storage Service. It contains a simple service
that allows you to store and fetch book cover images. You can interact with it locally through IntelliJ's
link:../s3/http/S3.http[http plugin].

The module includes examples for how to:

- Write a reasonable abstraction layer for the S3 sdk
- Locally run an S3 instance with your application thanks to with link:https://localstack.cloud/[LocalStack]
- Write tests which use a locally running S3 instead of a simple mock
